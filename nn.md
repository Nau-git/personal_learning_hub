# Neural Networks

The original motivation when neural networks were first invented was to write a software than can mimic how the human brain works.

in a nutshell: neuron takes in a bunch of inputs (numbers) and then outputs some other numbers.

Why neural networks bloomed in the last couple of decades eventhoughh they were invented in the 50s? The explosion of data and computing power.
