# Agent
It has been the buzzword of the year 2024. But, what is it exactly?

I like this definition of agent by Harrison Chase (CEO of Langchain) in his [blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/what-is-an-agent/):
```
An AI agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application.
```
It might be too technical and not everyone will agree with this definition. It is hard to define exactly what an agent is. 

Andrew Ng suggest this in his [The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-253/) newsletter: 
*rather than arguing over which work to include or exclude as being a true AI agent, we can acknowledge that there are different degrees to which systems can be "agentic".* 

Just like autonomous vehicles, for example, have levels of autonomy, we can also view AI agent capabilities as a spectrum. I really agree with this viewpoint and I think Andrew expressed it nicely.
