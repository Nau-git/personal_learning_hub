Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning and deep learning models.

1. **Purpose**: The goal of gradient descent is to find the values of the model parameters (weights) that minimize the cost function, which measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data.

2. **How it works**:
   - **Initialize Parameters**: Start with some initial values for the model parameters (usually randomly chosen).
   - **Compute the Gradient**: Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives, indicating the direction and rate of the steepest increase in the cost function.
   - **Update Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient by a certain step size, known as the learning rate. The update rule for each parameter \( \theta \) is: 
     \[
     \theta = \theta - \eta \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta}
     \]
     where \( \eta \) is the learning rate and \( J(\theta) \) is the cost function.
   - **Repeat**: This process is repeated iteratively until the cost function converges to a minimum value, or the improvement becomes negligible.

3. **Types of Gradient Descent**:
   - **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient and update parameters.
   - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses a single training example to compute the gradient and update parameters. This can be faster but introduces more noise in the updates.
   - **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Uses a small, random subset of the dataset (a mini-batch) to compute the gradient and update parameters. It balances the speed of SGD with the stability of batch gradient descent.

4. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter. If it's too small, the algorithm may take a long time to converge. If it's too large, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum and fail to converge.

5. **Convergence**: The algorithm stops when it converges to a minimum of the cost function, which might be a global minimum or a local minimum, depending on the function's landscape.
