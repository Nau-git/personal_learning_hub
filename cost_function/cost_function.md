## Cost Function
also known as a *loss function* or an *error function*, is a measure used in machine learning to quantify the error or difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual output or ground truth. The goal of any machine learning algorithm is to minimize this cost function to improve the accuracy of the model and make better predictions.

In supervised learning, the cost function is used to compare the predicted values (output by the model) with the true values (from the training dataset) and calculate the error. The cost function is then used in optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, to adjust the model's parameters in a way that minimizes the cost function.

There are different types of cost functions, and the choice of cost function depends on the type of machine learning problem and the type of algorithm being used. Some common cost functions include:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This is a common cost function used for regression problems. It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the true values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This cost function calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the true values.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: This cost function is commonly used for classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true probability distribution.
- **Hinge Loss**: This cost function is used for support vector machines (SVMs) and measures the distance between the predicted value and the true value, with a penalty for misclassified examples.

The choice of cost function is important because it can affect the performance of the machine learning algorithm. A good cost function should be differentiable, convex, and provide a good measure of the error between the predicted and true values.

In summary, a cost function is a measure of the error or difference between the predicted output of a machine learning model and the actual output or ground truth. The cost function is used to evaluate the performance of the model and optimize its parameters to improve its accuracy.
